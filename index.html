          body: `
Dear Students,

Please be advised that we will now be strictly enforcing our uniform policies, as unfortunately some students have been taking advantage of our leniency.

**Correct Summer Attire**

Please refer to our [Uniform Policy](https://www.stleonards.vic.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/information-handbook-for-families-2025.pdf) for the correct summer attire.  Some particular areas to note are:
- The blazer must be worn as the outermost garment when travelling to and from school.  This includes in your car while driving to school.
- Skirts and dresses must be worn at knee length. This should be precisely to the knee, both when standing and sitting.
- Shoes must be polished and scuff-free, including the soles of the shoes.
- Socks must be worn with the school stripes showing.

Students who are found to be in breach of these rules will be required to change at school, using the spare uniform pieces in the lost and found.

**Hairstyles**

Students are required to have their hair cut to a respectable length, at most to the shoulder.  Hair longer than the shoulder must be tied back in a ponytail.  If this ponytail also exceeds the shoulder, it must be tied in a bun.  If the bun is taller than three inches, students will be required wear a crown braid.

**Jewellery**

Students are permitted to wear only a single pair of earrings, which must be plain gold or silver sleepers or studs.  Offending jewellery will be confiscated and auctioned, with the proceeds being donated to the St Leonard's College Foundation.

**Make-up**

Students should not wear make-up to school. This includes mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, and nail polish.  Students whose cheeks are naturally rosy should wear a natural foundation to cover this up.  Students who have long eyelashes may be required to prove these are natural.

Our College remains committed to standards of decorum and conformity.

Yours sincerely,`,

      foursquare: {
          label: "Four Square rules",
          title: "A clarification of Four Square rules",
          role: "Head of Ball Sports",
          body: `
Dear Students,

It has come to our attention that some students have been playing Four Square incorrectly, using rules or variations that are not college approved.  This has resulted in some students being unfairly penalised, or staying in King for longer than they should, and several parents have raised concerns about this.

To clarify, the rules of Four Square are as follows:
- The game must played with four players, in the positions of King, Queen, Jack, and Dungeon.  
- The King always serves, and must serve to the Jack.
- A valid serve must bounce once in the King's square, and then once in the Jack's square.
- Players can hit the ball with any part of their arm or hand, or with their head or face, but not with their feet or legs.
- The ball must bounce an odd number of times in the receiving square before being returned.
- If the ball lands on the line it is "in", unless the receiver is a year level younger than the server, in which case the ball is "out".
- When a player loses a point, they move to the Dungeon, and the other players move up a square.  Unless the King loses to the Dungeon, in which case the King must leave the court and the Dungeon becomes the new King.
- Once a player has been King for 4 serves, all other players must declare Regicide and target them.
- If a player is King for 8 serves, they become Emperor, and other players must bow to them and call them "Your Excellency" until they lose their crown.
- If a player is King for 12 serves, they become Supreme Leader, and can change any game rules at will.

We hope that this clarifies the rules of Four Square, and we encourage all students to play by these rules.  We will be monitoring the courts closely, and any students found to be playing incorrectly will be required to attend a Four Square training session.

Yours sincerely,
          `

          title: "A reminder regarding tattoos and body art",
          role: "Faculty of Artistic Expression",
          body: `
Dear Students and Parents,

We would like to remind all students that tattoos and body art are not permitted in the Junior School.  This includes permanent tattoos, temporary tattoos, henna, face paint, and any other form of body art, including so-called "prison tattoos" performed with a biro.

We have received some disturbing reports of Junior School students leaving the school during lunch periods to visit Angry Mike's tattoo parlour (on the corner of Hampton and Rouen Streets) to get tattoos.  These have included some very inappropriate designs, including skulls, daggers, and the words "Mum" and "Dad".  We have also received reports of students getting tattoos of their favourite bands, including The Wiggles and Sigma Boy.

Students who are found to have tattoos or body art will be required to remove them immediately, and may be required to attend a tattoo removal session at the local laser clinic.

Please note we do make exceptions for students whose parents are tattoo artists, and use the child as a canvas to practice their work.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

Regards,
          `
